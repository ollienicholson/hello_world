# median = literally the middle value in a list of inputs
# [100, 90, 90, 80, 60] = 90
# midrange is the average or mean of the highest and lowest value in the list
# [100, 60] = 160/2 = 80
# average or mean is the sum divided by the number of inputs
# [100 + 90 + 90 + 80 + 60] / 5 .4
# mode = most common value: 90
# range: highest less lowest: 100 - 60 = 40
